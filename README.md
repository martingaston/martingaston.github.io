Firstly, thanks for taking the time to read this :bowtie:

## What's going on here?

I wanted a new look to my portfolio after finishing [Founders & Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com) but have been increasingly interested in the idea of doing _more_ with _less_ when it comes to things like word count, screen space and colour. I've been (for obvious reasons) living in a Bash terminal for the past few months and have always been a fan of a retro design, so wanted to combine them into a terse one-page portfolio that offered the following:

-   Monochrome
-   One type size (the font is [Iosevka](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka), which just so happens to be my current coding font)
-   Responsive design
-   Left alignment (like a _real_ terminal!)
-   A single design flourish in the blinking retro corner.

Also, I was originally mulling over whether to make my name ASCII art and eventually decided against it. It looked too vain.

Feedback always welcome :heart_eyes:
